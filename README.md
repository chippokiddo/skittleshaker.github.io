# Skittles Shaker

A fun and interactive simulation of shaking a cup of Skittles! In this project, you can shake virtual Skittles that have two sides, heads (s) and tails (no s). The Skittles start off gray, and when you shake the cup, they take on random colors. You keep shaking until all Skittles are tails. Try it out and have fun!

## 💡Features

- Randomly shake 64 Skittles to see their heads and tails.
- Skittles change to vibrant colors (e.g., red, yellow, green) when they land as heads or tails.
- Subtle shake animation
- Reset the simulation anytime with a simple click of the 'Start Over' button.
- Light/dark mode
