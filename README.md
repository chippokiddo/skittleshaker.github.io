# Skittles Shaker

A heads-or-tails simulation featuring Skittles! In this project, you can shake virtual Skittles that have two sides: heads (s) and tails (no s). The Skittles start off gray, and when you shake the container, they take on random colors, representing heads or tails. Keep shaking until all the Skittles end up as tails. Try it out and see how many shakes it takes to get all tails!

## 💡Features

- Randomly shake 64 Skittles to see their heads and tails.
- Skittles change to vibrant colors (e.g., red, yellow, green) when they land as heads or tails.
- Subtle shake animation
- Reset the simulation anytime by clicking the 'Start Over' button.
- Light/dark mode
