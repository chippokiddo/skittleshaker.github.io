# Skittles Shaker

A heads-or-tails simulation featuring Skittles. You can shake virtual Skittles that have two sides: heads (s) and tails (no s). The Skittles start off gray, and when you shake the container, they take on random colors, representing heads or tails. Keep shaking until all the Skittles end up as tails.

## 💡Features

- Randomly shake 64 Skittles to see their heads and tails.
- Skittles change to vibrant colors (e.g., red, yellow, green) when they land as heads or tails.
- Reset the simulation anytime by clicking the 'Start Over' button.
- Light/dark mode
- Shake counter
- Progress bar
- Shake sound effect
- Confetti celebration using [canvas-confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) when you reach all tails.
- Improved shake effect
- Subtle flip animation
